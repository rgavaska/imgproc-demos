# Image processing demos

This is a set of 9 interactive MATLAB demos to illustrate some common concepts in image processing. Each folder contains a file named 'demo.m', which is the main file that should be run. Some folders also contain a file named 'main_script.m', which runs a non-interactive program to illustrate the same concept, usually in a different way than the demo.

The programs should mostly be self-explanatory, but I do have plans to update them later with some documentation.

I had written these codes to form part of the teaching material as the Teaching Assistant for the course 'Image Processing and Computer Vision' in 2019 at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. These are distributed without any warranty (even implied), so use at your own risk!
