# Image processing demos

This is a set of 9 interactive MATLAB demos to illustrate some common concepts in image processing. Each folder contains a file named 'demo.m', which is the main file to run. Some folders also contain a file named 'main_script.m', which runs a non-interactive program to illustrate the same concept, usually in a different way than the demo.

The programs should mostly be self-explanatory, but I do have plans to update them later with some documentation.

These codes formed part of the teaching material for the course 'Image Processing and Computer Vision' at the Center for Continuing Education, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru.
