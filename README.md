# Image processing demos

This is a set of 9 interactive MATLAB demos to illustrate some common concepts in image processing. Each folder contains a file named 'demo.m', which is the main file that should be run. Some folders also contain a file named 'main_script.m', which runs a non-interactive program to illustrate the same concept, usually in a different way than the demo.

The programs should mostly be self-explanatory, but I do have plans to update them later with some documentation.
